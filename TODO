Find and fix anything with a TODO or FIXME tag in the code.

There is a lot of duplicate code still, this needs to be removed so its easier to 
keep update and bug free. Some examples would be the stuff in the _ids functions
in client.py or much of the code in the objects directory.

A test suite
	libtpproto-py badly needs a test suite, it should try to do the following,
		- Take each packet, turn it into a string then reform it, check the details
		are all the same
		- Have hand built packet strings which you reform a packet from, check the 
		details are correct
		- Test the client.py functions, this could be done with a dumb server which 
		just returns a bunch of strings to packets - this should also test weird 
		possabilities such as incomplete packets, incorrectly formatted packets,
		garbage, packets which are too big, etc
		- Test the server.py functions, not sure how you could do this, again it
		should test as many weird cases as you can think of.

		- Test the above in non-blocking and blocking mode, force situations where 
		the packets are slow to test if non-blocking is actually nn-blocking

		- Test all the above from a py2exe created executable
		- Test all the above from a McMillian Installer created executable
		- Test all the above from a "python frozen" created executable

Figure out how to support multiple versions
	Currently libtpproto-py only supports the currently in development version of
	the protocol. Somebody needs to figure out a way to both support and 
	automatically downgrade to the old version. A hack which kinda works is already
	in the code base but full support really needs to be added.

Package the library
	Make sure the setup.py still works and package for each release. Figure out how
	to do debian packages.
